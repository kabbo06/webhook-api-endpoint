# Building a CI/CD Pipeline with Docker Hub Webhooks and Node.js API Endpoint
In today's fast-paced software development environment, the need for efficient and automated deployment processes is more critical than ever. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines play a vital role in achieving this goal by automating the build, test, and deployment phases of software delivery. In this article, we'll explore the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline by developing our own tools using Docker Hub webhooks and a Node.js API endpoint. By leveraging Docker Hub's webhook functionality to trigger actions upon image updates and creating a custom Node.js API server to orchestrate deployment tasks, we'll demonstrate how to streamline the deployment process, improve productivity, and ensure consistent delivery of software updates. Additionally, we'll showcase the power of building custom tools tailored to our specific needs, providing insights into the process of tool development alongside CI/CD automation. Join us on this journey as we delve into the intricacies of CI/CD automation and empower your development workflow with modern deployment practices.

In this scenario, we will deploy a CI/CD pipeline where, when a developer pushes the Dockerfile of an updated application image to GitHub, the image can be built from the source code using GitHub Actions and pushed into a Docker Hub repository. Here, we have excluded this part and directly push the image to the Docker Hub registry. However, this process can be achieved easily, as already mentioned. Then, we will configure a Docker Hub repository webhook. When an image is pushed to the repository, it will trigger a webhook and make an API POST call to the API server. For this pipeline, we will create an API endpoint server using Node.js. It will run on a specific port, in this case, port 4000 at the /hook URL path. When it receives an API call from the Docker Hub webhook, it will perform deployment commands remotely. Specifically, it will execute a bash script on a remote server via SSH where our containerized application is running. This bash script will stop and remove the existing version of the image and deploy the new application by pulling the new version of the image. We will build this pipeline by following the step-by-step process outlined below.
